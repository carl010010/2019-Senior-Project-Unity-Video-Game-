# 2019 Senior Project The study of the shadowed: Theif  (Unity Video Game)
Here lies the a year worth of work.

The School I am about to graduate from (Just one more term!) * [Oregon Institute of Technology] (https://www.oit.edu/) reqired each student on the computer science BS track to complete an individual 3 term long project. Thusly named a Senior project.
For my Senior project I choose to create a video game, loosely based off of the Theif series.
